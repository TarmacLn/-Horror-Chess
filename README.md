# Horror Chess made by TarmacLn (gitHub)
This project was made for the lesson "Object-Oriented programming" for my University.
The code and the assets used on it are all made by me (Ioanna Andrianou 2023-2024).
This code is a simple chess game with no move restrictions that two players can play at any time.
It also has a timer for the player's turn as well as a leaderboard.
The theme of this chess is horror oriented so that's the reason it's named like that.
Feel free to use the code, with credits.
